# Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks

Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks (or SSPB for short) reintroduces vanilla-like smooth lighting to all non-fluid blocks with inset faces (e.g. dirt paths and how they have dark shading when directly next to a full block) when using Sodium, as Sodium removes this (or rather, fixes this, as it's technically a bug).

The strength of this shading is also adjustable.

Unless "Use vanilla lighting for path blocks" is enabled, this lighting will not be exactly the same as vanilla, only vanilla-like, as the way I'm doing this is entirely based on Sodium's smooth lighting code.

Requires [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric). If using the "Use vanilla lighting for path blocks" option, also requires [Indium](https://github.com/comp500/Indium) and [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) (or [Quilted Fabric API](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilted-fabric-api) if using Quilt).
