# Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks

Sodium Shadowy Path Blocks (or SSPB for short) reintroduces vanilla-like smooth lighting to all non-fluid blocks with inset faces (e.g. dirt paths and how they have dark shading when directly next to a full block), as Sodium removes this (or rather, fixes this, as it's technically a bug).

The strength of this shading is also adjustable.

This lighting is not exactly the same as vanilla, only vanilla-like, as the way I'm doing this is entirely based on Sodium's smooth lighting code.
